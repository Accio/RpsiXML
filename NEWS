    no file has implemented them (in this situation these handlers will stop the program)

  + source, availabilityList and experimentList elements of the entry can already be unmarshalled
  + global constant variables added to save memory and speed overhead in parsing. They follow the 
    naming convention of 'GC_mockClassName'. They will probably not be exported.
